## Features
- Save the current `teoria.on.ge` page for quick access
- Practice tickets one by one (local progress)
- Reset all saved tickets with one click
- Works fully offline (after install)

## Install

### From Chrome Web Store
https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ge-driving-tickets-manage/ommbkmhahoekfanjcmnpkhjepocbppmg


## How it works
- The extension injects a small content script on `teoria.on.ge/*` to read ticket IDs when you click **Practice**.
- Your saved page URL, ticket IDs and practice progress are stored **locally** via `chrome.storage`.
- No network requests are made to external servers.
